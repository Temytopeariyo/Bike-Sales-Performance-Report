### Data Source
The data used for this project was from IJAN Tutor database.

### Task
* Sales Trends and Cummute Distance: Analyzing sales as it relates to commute distance across the state.

* Age distribution and Product Performance: Recognizing top customers based on age bracket with significant sales contributions and Highlighting exceptional products in terms of age bracket and quantity purchased.

* Customer Educational level and Sales Correlation: Exploring correlations between customer educational level and sales.

* Occupational Income and Product performance: The average income per occupation was recognised in relation to the product sales.

* Car owners and Bike purchase: The distribution portray how car owners respond to the bike purchase across the state.

### Data Preparation and Transformation
To make ready dataset for the analysis, Power Bi was used to turn the unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. In response to the given task, a careful assessment of the necessary database tables was carried out. Specifically, the database table was imported from excel and tested for errors. The table which formed the basis for the subsequent steps was free of error during cleaning exercise.

Upon this, we are able to harmonise this dataset and turn the unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. 

Form this dataset, the following measures where created for easy visualizing: Average income, Bike Buyers, Non buyers, Number of Femaie buyers, Number of Male buyers and Total participants. These measures became the central point where all the other informations in our analysis could link to. By using specific measures from this table of dataset, we established connections to other related distributions. 

### Data Modelling
We only have a piece of dataset involved hence the logical representation of how data is structured and related within the tool and the collection of tables and relationships between them that are used to create reports and visualizations was not necessary since the intergration of tables were not involved. 

### Data Exploration and Visualization
As the data was structured, I made sure I created related calculations that would help the analysis. These calculations included key measures from this dataset and the following measures were created for easy visualizing: Average income, Bike Buyers, Non buyers, Number of Femaie buyers, Number of Male buyers and Total participants. These measures became the central point where all the other informations in our analysis could link to. 

### Sales Report - Visualization
During the visualization process, a comprehensive overview of our sales and customer metrics was provided through an information cards. The measures were dragged and dropped into these information cards and the Average income, Bike Buyers, Non buyers, Number of Femaie buyers, Number of Male buyers and Total participants were all showcased. For enhanced analytical exploration, slicers were introduced, allowing for focused drill-through. These slicers, Gender, Marrital Status and region facilitated more targeted analysis. The sales report was differenciated in terms of sales, income,age bracket, education, commute distance with the use of navigation button shown below:

Recognizing the potential need to address questions related to quantities purchased as it relates to income by occupation of customers, I implemented a navigation button. This button enabled a seamless transition to an analysis centered on quantities, addressing a specific aspect of the data for a more comprehensive perspective. The visual reports in terms of both average of income and Occupation is shown below:

### Sales Report - Visualization
Within the sales report, a range of visualizations were constructed to illuminate various aspects. Firstly, a visual depiction of age bracket distribution in relation to total sales was generated, shedding light on how different age groups contribute to overall sales. Similarly, separate visuals illustrated the correlation between customer gender, marital status, and total sales, offering distinct insights.The visual reort is shown below:

Employing a map visualization, geographical data was harnessed to reveal the origins of sales and their magnitudes across region in the state on the second sheet of the project. The visual reort is shown below:

Incorporating the slicers enhance navigation that helps us differenciate Gender, Marital Status, and Region dispositions toward bike purchase. A consistent framework was established for the sales performance report, enabling a cohesive analysis across regions by selecting through the slicers to visualise bike purchased through the use of navigation button shown below:

### Insights and Recommendations
The top 10 customers, based on their significant sales contributions, play a vital role in boosting the company's revenue. These high-value customers likely possess considerable purchasing power. Notably, no customer appears on both the high sales and high quantity lists, indicating a distinct nature between the two categories. Nonetheless, being present on either list signifies customer loyalty, showing commitment to the company through either high-value transactions or frequent engagement.

Overall, the analysis provides a positive outlook for sales beyond 2014, backed by compelling evidence.
