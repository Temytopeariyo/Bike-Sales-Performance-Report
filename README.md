# Bike-Sales-Performance-Report

### Introduction

In this project, I deemed it fit to delve into an in-depth exploration of sales and customer data, leveraging the Bike sales dataset, Hence, I Welcome you to the intriguing world of data analysis! This analysis aims to uncover valuable insights and trends that lie within the data, shedding light on the dynamics of sales, customer behaviors, and more. Join me on this adventure journey as we navigate through the numbers, revealing actionable findings that can drive strategic business decisions and enhance positive outcomes. This Sales Performance report provides information on how the age brackets, distance, gender and Income influence bikes purchase in three (3) of the world's continent. The report allows you to visualise at a glance the sales performance as they relate to those aforementioned factors. This way, you can measure performance and improve your sales strategy.

### Data Source
The data used for this project was from IJAN Tutor database.

### Task
* Sales Trends and Cummute Distance: Analyzing sales as it relates to commute distance across the state.

* Age distribution and Product Performance: Recognizing top customers based on age bracket with significant sales contributions and Highlighting exceptional products in terms of age bracket and quantity purchased.

* Customer Educational level and Sales Correlation: Exploring correlations between customer educational level and sales.

* Occupational Income and Product performance: The average income per occupation was recognised in relation to the product sales.

* Car owners and Bike purchase: The distribution portray how car owners respond to the bike purchase across the state.

### Data Preparation and Transformation
To make ready dataset for the analysis, Power Bi was used to turn the unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. In response to the given task, a careful assessment of the necessary database tables was carried out. Specifically, the database table was imported from excel and tested for errors. The table which formed the basis for the subsequent steps was free of error during cleaning exercise.

Upon this, we are able to harmonise this dataset and turn the unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. 

Form this dataset, the following measures where created for easy visualizing: Average income, Bike Buyers, Non buyers, Number of Femaie buyers, Number of Male buyers and Total participants. These measures became the central point where all the other informations in our analysis could link to. By using specific measures from this table of dataset, we established connections to other related distributions. 

### Data Modelling
We only have a piece of dataset involved hence the logical representation of how data is structured and related within the tool and the collection of tables and relationships between them that are used to create reports and visualizations was not necessary since the intergration of tables were not involved. 

### Data Exploration and Visualization
As the data was structured, I made sure I created related calculations that would help the analysis. These calculations included key measures from this dataset and the following measures were created for easy visualizing: Average income, Bike Buyers, Non buyers, Number of Femaie buyers, Number of Male buyers and Total participants. These measures became the central point where all the other informations in our analysis could link to. 

### Sales Report - Visualization
During the visualization process, a comprehensive overview of our sales and customer metrics was provided through an information cards. The measures were dragged and dropped into these information cards and the Average income, Bike Buyers, Non buyers, Number of Femaie buyers, Number of Male buyers and Total participants were all showcased. For enhanced analytical exploration, slicers were introduced, allowing for focused drill-through. These slicers, Gender, Marrital Status and region facilitated more targeted analysis. The sales report was differenciated in terms of sales, income,age bracket, education, commute distance with the use of navigation button shown below:

Recognizing the potential need to address questions related to quantities purchased as it relates to income by occupation of customers, I implemented a navigation button. This button enabled a seamless transition to an analysis centered on quantities, addressing a specific aspect of the data for a more comprehensive perspective. The visual reports in terms of both average of income and Occupation is shown below:

### Sales Report - Visualization
Within the sales report, a range of visualizations were constructed to illuminate various aspects. Firstly, a visual depiction of age bracket distribution in relation to total sales that was generated, shedding light on how different age groups contribute to overall sales. Similarly, separate visuals illustrated the correlation between customer gender, marital status, and total sales, offering distinct insights.The visual report is shown below:

Employing a map visualization, geographical data was harnessed to reveal the origins of sales and their magnitudes across region in the state on the second sheet of the project. The visual report is shown below:

Incorporating the slicers enhance navigation that helps us differenciate Gender, Marital Status, and Region dispositions toward bike purchase. A consistent framework was established for the sales performance report, enabling a cohesive analysis across regions by selecting through the slicers to visualise bike purchased through the use of navigation button shown below:

### Insights and Recommendations
The top customers, based on their significant sales contributions, play a vital role in boosting the company's revenue. These high-value customers likely possess considerable purchasing power attributed to their occupation, age bracket, Education and Commute distance. 

Our analysis covered a range of intriguing sales trends. The total customers across the distributions amounted to 1,000 out of which, 511 were Males and 489 were Females. Notably, 481 out of the 1,000 were bike buyers and the remining 519 were none bike buyers. Based on the occupational distribution of Bike buyers, Professional occupational group has the highest customers of bike buyers followed by Skilled Manual which recorded 115, while Clerical has 88, Management 75 and the least bike buyers based on the occupational category is Manual with a total number of 55 bike buyers.
There was a notable surge in total sales, reaching 200 quantities sold based on commute distance of 0 -1 mile to the store. While quantities sold witnessed a decrease to 33 on the commute distance above 10 miles to the Bike store. An unprecedented peak emerged to the distance of 2-5 miles, recording the highest 95 sales despite its distance to the bike store. Summarily, one can hardly say that the commute distance greatly affects bike purchase as customers living 2.5 miles to the Bike store buy more than the customers living 1-2 miles. Hence, the analysis provides a positive outlook for sales beyond the parameters provided.
